The Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model is a reference model that standardizes the communication and provides interoperability of various communication systems with standard protocols.

Though the OSI is a conceptual model, the actual implementation of the OSI model is *TCP/IP* model. In this post, I want to share and compare different layers, their names, protocols, devices, and functionalities at a glance for a quick reference.
