The Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model is a characteristic model and you have learned and came across many time from your college days. The OSI model standardizes the communication and provides interoperability of various communication systems with standard protocols.

The real world implementation of the OSI model is called TCP/IP model and in this post, I want to share different layers, names, protocols, devices and functionalities at a glance for a quick reference.
